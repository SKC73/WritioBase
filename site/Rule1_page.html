		<h2 id="Rule1-subhead">The truth is...</h2><br><br>
			<p id="Rule1-text">...I can't teach you how not to be boring. This would be like a comic saying she could teach someone else how to be funny. Yes, there are skills you need to learn as part of your craft that will help you improve your ability to tell a story, write a character, build a world. It's only after you've learned all the rules and practiced them again and again and again, that you will start to get <em> a feel</em> for what makes a story interesting, what makes a story good. But it's all about feel.</p><br>

			<p id="Rule1-text">I've put this rule as the first rule, because it's the Alpha rule. In philosophy, this would be the equivalent of an "a priori" rule. It's the condition of possiblity for all the other rules to work. If your writing is boring, no one is going to read it, and all the effort you put into training yourself on rhetoric and narrative structure and character development will be for naught. This doesn't mean you can't work at not being boring. I was an academic at one point in my life. I was well-trained on how to bore others with my writing. I had to unlearn those skills. So there is hope. In a way, you could say the Alpha Objective of this entire Course series is to teach writers how not to be boring. But, like I said above, you have to learn all the rules to follow, then practice practice practice until they all work together to make it work.</p><br>
	
			<p id="Rule1-text">You have to develop <em>your feel</em> for it. It takes a lot of work. But when you get that first email from a magazine saying they want to buy your story (ie. they think you're interesting enough to pay you for your writing!), you'll know it was all worth it.</p>
